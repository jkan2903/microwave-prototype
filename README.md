# Microwave Prototype

## Overview
This project implements the control logic behind a microwave oven appliance. The features of focus include: displaying wall clock time, a cooking functionality for a specific time, and a timer functionality. A majority of the underlying complexities in this system stems from managing how each of these functions overlap. The hardware setup consists of a 7-segment LED display, push buttons, breadboard, and an AVR-BLE development board. The user interacts with the system through these buttons, and the wall-clock time is displayed when the system is idle.
